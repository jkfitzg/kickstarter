Through what the characters say, and perhaps more importantly what they don\\'t say, what they avoid saying, the play explores the relationship of a pair of divergent brothers through the appearance of a homeless stranger. The play explores the themes of isolation and the desire for connection through the relationships between the three characters.\\xa0</p><p>SHOW INFORMATION:\\xa0</p><p>Common Ground, 4815B Hillsborough Road Durham, January 2-4, \\xa08-11, 15-18. \\xa0Shows at 7:30 PM, Sundays at 2:00 PM. \\xa0\\xa0</p><p>WHY WE NEED YOU: Putting on theatre isn\\'t a money making venture. We\\'re hoping to raise around $1,100, which will cover royalties ($825) Buddhas ($200 or so) and Kickstarter fees. If we can at least raise this much, then additional ticket sales will only have to cover our venue costs, marketing, and of course something for the production team.\\xa0</p><p>WILL THE SHOW HAPPEN IF YOU DON\\'T HIT YOUR GOAL? Yes it will! But getting $1,100 would do wonders for our ability to fund the rest of the costs and the inevitable unplanned incidentals.\\xa0</p><p>MORE SHOW INFO: Our company blog is\\xa0<a href=\"http://southstreamproductions.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://southstreamproductions.blogspot.com/</a>.

Well, low probability of tornadoes. Hopefully we&#39;ll avoid a major snow storm ... I mean, something can go wrong I suppose. But we have a really strong team of people working on it and I&#39;m sure we&#39;re up to the challenge.</p>\\n\\n<p>The biggest challenge will be getting YOU to come see it. So support the show with a kickstarter pledge. We need your participation to build interest and commit to going. It will also help us defray some costs we have already incurred up front. Cash flow is a problem with small independent theatre and your participation will help us bring this show to the Triangle.</p>\\n\\n<p>We have a strong team to bring this production to you. The cast are all experienced actors that most in the Triangle acting community will recognize. The cast will be Ryan Brock as Mitch, Brook North as Ashton, and John Honeycutt as Davies. Jay O&#39;Berski will direct and the stage manager will be JaMeeka Holloway-Burrell. Our creative team also includes Wil Deedler (Buddha maker), Jay O&#39;Berski (Staging Design and Concept), Zachary Corsa (sound design), and Daniel McCord who designed our graphics.</p>\\n<a class=\"h5 bold\" href=\"/help/faq/kickstarter%20basics#Acco\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about accountability on Kickstarter</a>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"mb6\">\\n<div class=\"mobile-show py2\"></div>\\n<div class=\"NS-projects-faqs js-project-faqs\" id=\"project-faqs\">\\n<h3 class=\"normal mb4\">\\nFAQ\\n<div class=\"divider clear\"></div>\\n</h3>\\n<ul class=\"faqs\">\\n<li class=\"faq\" id=\"project_faq_113192\">\\n<div class=\"faq-question\">\\n<a class=\"js-faq-question-toggle\" href=\"#project_faq_113192\" name=\"project_faq_113192\">\\n<span class=\"ss-icon ss-navigateright\"></span>\\n<span class=\"question\">Can I buy multiple tickets through Kickstarter?</span>\\n</a>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">\\n<p>Yes!

      "Frequently compared to Becket and variously described as \"tragi-comic\" and \"darkly funny,\" The Caretaker is commonly acknowledged as one of playwright Harold Pinter's masterpieces. The play takes place in a cluttered upper bedroom of a row house. Through what the characters say, and perhaps more importantly what they don't say, what they avoid saying, the play explores the relationship of a pair of divergent brothers through the appearance of a homeless stranger. The play explores the themes of isolation and the desire for connection through the relationships between the three characters. SHOW INFORMATION: Common Ground, 4815B Hillsborough Road Durham, January 2-4,  8-11, 15-18.  Shows at 7:30 PM, Sundays at 2:00 PM.   WHY WE NEED YOU: Putting on theatre isn't a money making venture. We're hoping to raise around $1,100, which will cover royalties ($825) Buddhas ($200 or so) and Kickstarter fees. If we can at least raise this much, then additional ticket sales will only have to cover our venue costs, marketing, and of course something for the production team. WILL THE SHOW HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T HIT YOUR GOAL? Yes it will! But getting $1,100 would do wonders for our ability to fund the rest of the costs and the inevitable unplanned incidentals. MORE SHOW INFO: Our company blog is http://southstreamproductions.blogspot.com/. Check back for rehearsal photos and other ruminations.\n",

      "Risks? Well, low probability of tornadoes. Hopefully we'll avoid a major snow storm ... I mean, something can go wrong I suppose. But we have a really strong team of people working on it and I'm sure we're up to the challenge.\n",
      "The biggest challenge will be getting YOU to come see it. So support the show with a kickstarter pledge. We need your participation to build interest and commit to going. It will also help us defray some costs we have already incurred up front. Cash flow is a problem with small independent theatre and your participation will help us bring this show to the Triangle.\n",
      "We have a strong team to bring this production to you. The cast are all experienced actors that most in the Triangle acting community will recognize. The cast will be Ryan Brock as Mitch, Brook North as Ashton, and John Honeycutt as Davies. Jay O'Berski will direct and the stage manager will be JaMeeka Holloway-Burrell. Our creative team also includes Wil Deedler (Buddha maker), Jay O'Berski (Staging Design and Concept), Zachary Corsa (sound design), and Daniel McCord who designed our graphics.\n",
