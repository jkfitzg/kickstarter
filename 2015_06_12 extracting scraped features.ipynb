      "Our goal when we started this project roughly one year ago was to automate the interpretation of chemical test strips using the power of today's smartphones.  Our LabStrip Meter design began simply as an idea made real through Lego blocks.  Those early models helped us figure out the basic meter geometries and critical design inputs.  It became clear that it was critical to control the light source when imaging the strip, so we moved to an enclosed box and augmented the iPhone's flash.  The design then moved to hand-made models of foamboard and plastic.  We then solicited the help of the professionals at Speck Design of Palo Alto, CA who are well known for their iOS device accessory designs.  They came up with an elegant core industrial design.  Source One Product Development of Murrieta, CA then translated Speck's industrial model into a design capable of taking LabStrip Meter to large-scale manufacturing.  We hope that you will help us write the next chapter in LabStrip's evolution.\n",

      "We knew that we would need both an app and Cloud system to collect the data and implement our mathematical algorithm used to turn photos into measured values for the strip tests.  During the development of the meter, we showed that the best performance for strip measurements was obtained when we physically calibrated each lot of strips using actual samples of known value in lieu of simply using the color charts supplied with the strips.  This made linking the calibration we do in our facility with each user's phone a necessity for the system.  A basic mobile application that linked the data collected from the LabStrip Meter to our back-end Cloud made the most sense.  The LabStrip Mobile app and Anywhere Science Cloud with associated web portal co-evolved with the development of the meter.We also realized that we could take advantage of the ability of the iPhone 4S to communicate with low-powered wireless sensors.  This offered us the chance to pull more frequent measurements from BLE sensors (such as wireless thermometers) and load that data to an Anywhere Science Cloud account along with LabStrip measurements.  On the output side, we successfully demonstrated  sending and displaying our data to BLE-enabled wristwatches (such as the MetaWatch.)  We are eager to work with developers who want to integrate their wireless sensors into our ecosystem....that's really cool, now what can I do with it?  Below are just a few of the myriad potential uses of the system:\n",

      "Use your LabStrip Meter to measure the chemical health of your pool and/or spa.  The test strip values (pH, free chlorine, alkalinity, and stabilizer) are automatically interpreted and stored in your Anywhere Science Cloud account.  If you need to make adjustments to your chemicals, our software can tell you how much of each chemical to add to bring your water back to healthy levels.  Using just the right amount of these chemicals is healthier for you, your family, and the environment.  You can also set up \"triggers\" from within your Cloud account to send out SMS messages, social media alerts, emails, or notes to your BLE-enabled MetaWatch when measurements reach a threshold that you define.  Automatically alert your friends when conditions are just right for a pool party at your place!\n",

      "LabStrip allows students and teachers the opportunity to take their laboratories out of the four walls of the classroom and into the real world to make measurements.  In the hypothetical example above, students measure the pH of rainwater locally.  Data can be shared in the Anywhere Science Cloud such that all students participating in the study can make use of each other's measurements.  Such data could then be combined with other useful information from the Internet based on time, date, and location to provide a very rich database.  Students could then hypothesize on the origin of the differences in neutral vs. acidic vs. basic rain observations based on geographic and environmental considerations.  This is one simple example to highlight the power of the LabStrip approach to enrich science education through measurement and collaboration. We are eager to see what other experiments students and teachers are able to imagine to take full use of LabStrip's capabilities.\n",

      "LabStrip is a convenient way to keep track of the health of your aquarium or fish-stocked pond.  At delivery of the Kickstarter rewards, you will be able to measure several of the chemical parameters which indicate a healthy environment for your fish (pH, chlorine, and alkalinity).  Your data is stored automatically in the Anywhere Science Cloud along with any notes and/or observations you wish to make (such as tank cleaning, filter changes, or chemical additions).  We can also offer guidance to put your measurements in perspective and suggest what you should do next based on those data.  Many fishtank owners simply wait until the tank gets visibly fouled before acting.  LabStrip can help you identify the invisible early signs of water contamination that can threaten the health of your fish.\n",

      " 1. Wholesale Ordering (30%) - the biggest reason we need your help in launching our business is the massive cost of ordering in bulk. While our products are all assembled and made by hand, the supplies that we need to craft them are sold in large quantities that become costly very quickly.2. Product Line Development (30%) - while we hope you enjoy our spice kit, we have other projects in the works that we would love to also share with you! These funds will support growth in the development of prototypes of these products. Coffee, tea, and cocktail lovers stay tuned!3. Printing Services (15%) - these funds will be used to cover costs of printing items such as thank you notes, informational inserts for our kits, shirts, aprons, business cards, package labels, stickers, you name it!4. Kickstarter Fees (10%) - between Kickstarter and Amazon Payments, about 10% of the total funds that we raise never make their way to the company. We acknowledge this in setting our goals.5. Existing Expenses (08%) - money spent on prototyping, testing, and initial batch ordering are all what we file under our existing expenses.6. Marketing (05%) - in our early stages, we'd like to remain focused on developing the best product we can. Social media and networking will be our main venues of marketing, but we would like to dedicate some money to online and print advertising!7. Website (02%) -  last, but certainly not least, we will allocate the smallest portion of our funds to building an e-commerce company website to sell and promote the brand that you have all so generously helped to bring to life!\n",

Keeping spices preserved in whole form allows them to maintain their natural oils that are released when they are crushed or ground. By freshly grinding your spices each time you cook, you are ensuring that those oils are released into your cooking as late as possible. As for storing spices, they should be kept in a cool, dry area.\n",
